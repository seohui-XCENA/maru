    NIXL 1.2.0 closes a failed endpoint in its error callback but keeps the

    ``ucp_ep_rkey_unpack``). A BaseException, so no handler swallows it.
    """


class FakeNixlAgent:
    """Stands in for ``nixl._api.nixl_agent``.

    Every agent registers itself in a class-level registry keyed by name so
    that ``add_remote_agent`` can resolve metadata to a peer. Transfers copy
    bytes with ``ctypes.memmove``.

    A registration of an address range gets the key the same range had
    before, as the RoCE NIC this was checked on does (design note 5.4); a new
    range gets a new key. As with the real agent, a
    transfer can only name remote ranges whose metadata was loaded: full
    metadata (``get_agent_metadata``) covers every current registration of
    the peer, partial metadata only the registrations it lists (with their
    keys), and partial metadata without connection info cannot introduce a
    new peer. A transfer carries the key it was set up with; if the peer no
    longer holds that registration when the transfer reaches it, the
    transfer ends in ``ERR`` and moves nothing, even if the same range was
    registered again under a new key. As a reliable connection does after a
    remote access error, the connection breaks: every later transfer to that
    peer ends in ``ERR`` until the peer is removed and loaded again.

    ``stall`` keeps every new transfer in progress (no bytes move) until
    :meth:`finish_stalled` completes them, which is how a test reproduces a
    transfer that misses its deadline and lands later.

    A transfer's handle and its packets end apart. :meth:`fail_stalled` ends
    the stalled handles in ``ERR``; with ``late`` their packets, already read
    from the source, stay in the network, and neither releasing the handle,
    removing the peer, nor ending the source's registration or agent stops
    them: :meth:`deliver_late` lands each one whose destination agent is open
    and still holds the range under the key the transfer was set up with
    (the remote side for a WRITE, the local side for a READ). A transfer uses
    the connection (QP) to the peer agent whose metadata was loaded, so a new
    agent of the same name, or one registering the same range under the same
    key, is not reached through it. :meth:`close` ends the agent as a process
    exit does: its registrations and connections go, a transfer it posted
    that has not yet read its source moves nothing, and no late packet lands
    in its memory.

    :meth:`fail_endpoint` is what UCX does when a peer stops answering: the
    connection fails without any transfer seeing it. Transfers to the peer
    then end in ``ERR``, notifications to it are refused, and loading its
    metadata again before removing it raises :class:`LoadIntoFailedEndpoint`,
    as NIXL crashes there. Notifications travel the same connection as
    transfers: one to an agent that has ended fails the connection, and none
    reaches a later agent of the same name. Notifications sent to an agent
    stay in its ``notifs`` until it calls ``get_new_notifs``.
