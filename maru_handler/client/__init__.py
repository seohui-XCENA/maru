"""MaruClient: the worker side of the multi-storage structure.

A worker keeps two connections: ServerConn to MaruServer (session, lookup and
pin, unpin) and StorageConn to the StorageService of its node (attach, credit,
write_done, fetch). MaruClient hides both behind the MaruHandler methods, so
the vLLM connector does not change with them (design 4.2).
