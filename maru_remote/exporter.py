"""NixlExporter: a node run's whole L1 mappings, registered with its NIC.

A pool is registered once per run, whole, and stays registered until the run
ends: a peer reaches any page of it by the pool's base address and the key
in its partial metadata. Deregistration is the only fence for RDMA that may
still be in the network, so a mapping is unmapped only after it succeeded.
